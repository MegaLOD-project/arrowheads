# Arrowhead Project

This repository serves as a set of practices for defining models and datasets of Arrowheads from the chronology between Chalcolithic and Early/Middle Bronze Age (2800/2900 to 1500 BC).

# Goals
The "ArrowHead" project aims to develop a website that will be a repository of arrowheads from the Chalcolithic and the Early/Middle Bronze Ages in Portugal. This website would serve the general public interested in arrowheads, researchers, and postgraduate students in this subject. The repository will provide two data services: a SPARQL server and an API/XML service.

The specific objectives of the project are:
1. to define the functional requirements of the website;
2. to define a technology-independent conceptual model for the description of arrowheads from the Chalcolithic and the Early/Middle Bronze Age in Portugal;
3. to define two data models:
    3.1 XSD model;
    3.2 RDF model - as a first approach we aim to create a metadata application profile (MAP);
4. to develop the website repository and the data services.
