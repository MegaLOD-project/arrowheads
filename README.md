# Arrowhead Repository

This repository serves as a set of practices for defining models and datasets of Arrowheads from the chronology between Chalcolithic and Early/Middle Bronze Age (2800/2900 to 1500 BC).

# Goals
The "ArrowHead" project aims to develop a website that will be a repository of arrowheads from the Chalcolithic and the Early/Middle Bronze Ages in Portugal. This website would serve the general public interested in arrowheads, researchers, and postgraduate students in this subject. The repository will provide two data services: a SPARQL server and an API/XML service.

The specific objectives of the project are:
1. to define the requirements of the website (functional, non-functional, informational);
2. to define a technology-independent conceptual model for the description of arrowheads from the Chalcolithic and the Early/Middle Bronze Age in Portugal;
3. to define two data models:
    3.1 XSD model;
    3.2 RDF model - as a first approach, we aim to create a metadata application profile (MAP);
4. to develop the website repository and the data services.

# Content of the repository
In this repository, you can find the following:
1. The definition of the Metadata Application Profile (see file AH-MAP.md).
2. The definition of the two metadata application profiles (see folder "ms").
3. THe definition of the 8 vocabulary encoding schemes (see folder "ves").
4. The documentation of the MAP (see folder "Documentation"), with the data dictionary, a data template excel file, and the domain model of the AH-MAP (in pdf).
5. The MAP testing data file in Turtle and Excel (see folder "data").

This work is published in the paper "Promoting interoperability on the datasets of the arrowheads findings of the Chalcolithic and the Early/Middle Bronze Age", published in the proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries held in LJUBLJANA, Slovenia, September 24 - 27, 2024.
