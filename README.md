# MegaLOD Repository - v1.1

This repository serves as a set of practices for defining models and datasets of Items from the chronology between Chalcolithic and Early/Middle Bronze Age (2800/2900 to 1500 BC).

# Goals
The MegaLOD project aims to develop a virtual museum that will be a repository of items from the Chalcolithic and the Early/Middle Bronze Ages. This website would serve the general public interested in items found in sites that are from the chronology between Chalcolithic and Early/Middle Bronze Age (2800/2900 to 1500 BC) , researchers, and postgraduate students in this subject. The repository will provide two data services: a SPARQL server and an API/XML service.

The specific objectives of the project are:
1. to define a technology-independent conceptual model for the description of items from the Chalcolithic and the Early/Middle Bronze Age;
2. to define two data models:
    1 XSD model;
    2 RDF model - as a first approach, we aim to create a metadata application profile (MAP);
4. to develop the data services.

# Content of the repository
In this repository, you can find the following:
1. The definition of the Metadata Application Profile (see file MegaLOD-MAP.md).
2. The definition of Metadata Schemes (see folder "ms").
3. The definition of vocabulary encoding schemes (see folder "ves").
4. The documentation of the MAP (see folder "Documentation"), with the data dictionary, a data template excel file, and the domain model of the AH-MAP (in pdf).
5. The MAP testing data file in Turtle and Excel (see folder "data").
