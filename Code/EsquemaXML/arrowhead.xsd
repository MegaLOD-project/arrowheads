        <xs:documentation xml:lang="en">This class describes the general concept of archaeological excavation intended as a 
            coordinated set ofactivities performed on an area considered as part of a broader topographical, rural, urban,
             or monumental context. An archaeological excavation is usually under the responsibility of a 
             coordinator, officially designated, which is legally and scientifically responsible for all the
              activities carried out within each of the excavation process units and is also responsible for the 
              documentation of the whole process.

    <xs:annotation>
        <xs:documentation xml:lang="en">This class comprises extents in space, in particular on the surface of the earth, in 
            the pure sense of physics: independent from temporal phenomena and matter. The instances of E53 Place are usually 
            determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated
             geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. 
             It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation. It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 
             Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often 
             more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested 
             in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with
              reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would 
              require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, 
              and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance. Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place 
              determination. The model foresees the notion of a ""section"" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.

            instance of E18 Physical Thing of a kind relevant for the mission of the observation or regarded as
            potentially relevant for some community (identity). This observation produces knowledge about the
            existence of the respective thing at a particular place in or on surrounding matter. This knowledge
            may be new to the group of people the actor belongs to. In that case we would talk about a discovery.
            The observer may recognize or assign an individual identity of the thing encountered or regard only
            the type as noteworthy in the associated documentation or report. In archaeology there is a particular interest 
            if an object is found “in situ”, i.e. if its embedding in the surrounding matter supports the assumption that the 
            object was not moved since the archaeologically relevant deposition event. The surrounding matter with the relative 
            position of the object in it as well as the absolute position and time of the observation may be recorded in order to 
            enable inferences about the history of the E18 Physical Thing. In Biology, additional parameters may be recorded like 
            the kind of ecosystem, if the biological individual survives the observation, what detection or catching devices have 
            been used or if the encounter event supported the detection of a new biological kind (“taxon”).
