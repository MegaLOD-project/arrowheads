In this meeting, we discussed the multiple ways to identify the arrowheads in a unique way, coming to the conclusion that a reaserch on arrowheads was needed in order to reach a better understanding.
Up to this point, there has been developed 2 XML files containing demonstrative information on arrowheads and an XSD file that defines the structure of the XML files mentioned before. The database eXist has also been installed, already containing the files mentioned before. This was necessary in order to begin testing and trying out various XPath functions.

**TO DO:**
  1. Marco: Find out if xml schemas about arrowheads already exist online and understand how they describe them.

It was defined that we will use XML technology  for the development of the project so that we can provide interoperability.
We also defined that a website will be developed, containing a form, that will allow the quering of the database and than wil provide sorting and visualization of the data. We wil use ExistDB as database technology.
The programming languages to be used to manipulate the database are XML, XSD, XSLT and XQuery. THe Website will be developed in PHP.

**To DO:**
  1. Marco: installs EXISTDB in a local laptop, studies EXISTSDB
  2. Mariana: studies the possibilities of Webhosting
  3. Maria Luisa: provides Marco with a set of php files examples
