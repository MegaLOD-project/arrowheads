It was defined that we will use XML technology  for the development of the project so that we can provide interoperability.
We also defined that a website will be developed, containing a form, that will allow the quering of the database and than wil provide sorting and visualization of the data. We wil use ExistDB as database technology.
The programming languages to be used to manipulate the database are XML, XSD, XSLT and XQuery. THe Website will be developed in PHP.

**To DO:**
  1. Marco: installs EXISTDB in a local laptop, studies EXISTSDB
  2. Mariana: studies the possibilities of Webhosting
  3. Maria Luisa: provides Marco with a set of php files examples
